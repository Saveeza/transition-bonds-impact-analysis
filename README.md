## 📑 **About This Project**

This project expands on my published article:  
👉 [From Greenwashing to Real Impact — Why Transition Bonds Matter](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-greenwashing-real-impact-why-transition-bonds-saveeza-chaudhry--pbblf)

It goes beyond narrative to apply:
- Quantitative data analysis (issuance trends, ESG scores)
- Visualization of market growth vs. policy credibility
- Commentary rooted in policy frameworks & standards (e.g., CBI, EU Taxonomy)
- *Real references & external datasets* (as cited in article)

## 🌍 **Context & real-life relevance**
Transition bonds are widely marketed as the “bridge” to decarbonization — but questions remain about:
- Alignment with **EU Green Bond Standard & CBI taxonomy**
- Use-of-proceeds vs. actual impact
- Heavy industry issuers & credibility gap
- Policy risk from future regulation

This project uses data analysis to test if market growth matches *real decarbonization potential* — a key skill in sustainable finance & ESG risk analytics.
