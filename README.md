## 📑 **About This Project**

This project expands on my published article:  
👉 [From Greenwashing to Real Impact — Why Transition Bonds Matter](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-greenwashing-real-impact-why-transition-bonds-saveeza-chaudhry--pbblf)

It goes beyond narrative to apply:
- Quantitative data analysis (issuance trends, ESG scores)
- Visualization of market growth vs. policy credibility
- Commentary rooted in policy frameworks & standards (e.g., CBI, EU Taxonomy)
- *Real references & external datasets* (as cited in article)

✅ Tests real-world data against narrative claims  
✅ Focuses on **impact** — not just issuance volume  
✅ Links directly to published article → shows communication & research skills  
✅ Fully documented, with references & context

## 🧰 **Project Structure**

- `data/` → Dataset on global transition bond issuance & ESG scores
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebook:
  - Issuance growth analysis (2019–2024)
  - ESG rating correlation
  - Sector-level exposure
  - Commentary on credibility risk
- `requirements.txt` → Python libraries

## 🌍 **Context & real-life relevance**
Transition bonds are widely marketed as the “bridge” to decarbonization — but questions remain about:
- Alignment with **EU Green Bond Standard & CBI taxonomy**
- Use-of-proceeds vs. actual impact
- Heavy industry issuers & credibility gap
- Policy risk from future regulation

This project uses data analysis to test if market growth matches *real decarbonization potential* — a key skill in sustainable finance & ESG risk analytics.
